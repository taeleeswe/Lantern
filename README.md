# Lantern (Campground Reviews Site)

Lantern is a full-stack web application for sharing and reviewing campgrounds. It provides users with a platform to explore different campgrounds, read reviews, and share their own camping experiences. This project is a part of Colt Steele's web dev bootcamp course on udemy.
